Choose your own adventure for Critical Studies presentation

This website was created for Sheldon Brown's Critical Studies course at UAL's Creative Computing Institute in order to tell the story of a utopia in which people had the ability to filter what they saw and heard (to varying degrees).

It runs on Django 3 and takes the form of a choose your own adventure story, complete with a UI for Penelope.

I will in the near future try to actually build something like this, a prototype, using a camera and TV plus some TBD ML model.
